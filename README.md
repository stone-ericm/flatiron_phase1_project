# Flatiron Phase 1 Project

In this project I used the pandas python library as well as seaborn to analyze the film industry. My goal was to decipher what direction a hypothetical newcomer to the industry with a large budget should focus on trying to produce.

I concluded that a newcomer to the industry would have the best chance at a high return on investment if they pursued Adventure/Science Fiction type films.
